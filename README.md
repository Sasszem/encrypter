# Encrypter
A simple encrypter program in D. Sorry for no comments in code

One of my friends wrote a simple encryption program is Java, and I got the idea to write something similar. I've chosen the D language, cuz it's awesome!

I've used DUB from code.dlang.org to build this project. Type `dub run --build=release` to run the program.
